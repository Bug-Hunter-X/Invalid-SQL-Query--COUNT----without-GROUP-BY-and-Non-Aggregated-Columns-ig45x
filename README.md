This repository contains an example of a common SQL error involving the use of the `COUNT(*)` aggregate function without a corresponding `GROUP BY` clause.  The error occurs when you try to select non-aggregated columns along with the aggregated count.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly structure the query to resolve the ambiguity and obtain the desired results.  The provided SQL files (`bug.sql` and `bugSolution.sql`) illustrate the problem and its solution.
