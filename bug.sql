The SQL query uses the `COUNT(*)` aggregate function without a `GROUP BY` clause, but it also includes non-aggregated columns in the SELECT list.  This is not valid SQL in most database systems (except for some less common ones which might have implementation-specific behavior) because it's ambiguous which rows' non-aggregated values to return when there are multiple groups.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), column1, column2 FROM my_table;
```
